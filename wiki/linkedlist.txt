I learned that a singly linked list is a list where each 
'node' points to the next piece of data in the list.
a doubly linked list is a linked list where each node points not on
ly to the next node in the list but also to the previous piece of data as well
the only way to traverse a linked list is to utilize a while loop
given that each node is nested in the last is is not possible to 
use a traditional 'for' loop to traverse a linked list.
you must us a current node indicator and a while loop
